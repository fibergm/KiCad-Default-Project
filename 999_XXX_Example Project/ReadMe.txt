# Standard project 
This structure is (at least for me) the easiest way for tackling fullstack project. 

#How to start.

- Move copy the 999_XXX_Example project into your project libary
- Rename the folder to your project name eg. 015 Spotlight
- Run the Project_initialisation.exe
--It will ask if you want to rename the project or use the folder name. 
- Rejoice your project is now set up.
